This is an example of a script that uses Microsoft's IFilter technology to look at files' contents.

Since Windows 8 (because of Reader, I presume), Microsoft has included an IFilter support plugin for PDF files, allowing indexing of their contents out of the box. If you're on 7, just install SumatraPDF. 

You can also use this script to get the text contents of a Word document, provided the architecture of the installed Office matches the architecture of the AutoHotkey executable.
